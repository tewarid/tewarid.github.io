I successfully built an embedded Linux system for Raspberry Pi using Buildroot [recently]({% link _posts/2014/2014-07-15-embedded-linux-system-for-raspberry-pi-with-buildroot.md %}), and decided it was time to add some useful packages to it. The first that came to mind is Node.js. Having that on the Linux system will allow me to serve an HTML5 UI to any computer with a browser, on the same network.

Invoke

```bash
make menuconfig 
```

in buildroot folder to obtain the configuration UI. Node.js requires IPv6 support so I enabled that in the Toolchain menu thus

![buildroot_ipv6](/assets/img/buildroot-toolchain-ipv6.png)

Then I enabled Node.js and npm from the Target packages menu thus

![buildroot_nodejs](/assets/img/buildroot-packages-nodejs.png)

![buildroot_npm](/assets/img/buildroot-packages-npm.png)

I followed that up by issuing a full build thus

```bash
make clean
make
```

Buildroot stores all downloads in the dl folder, so it will only download whatever isn't already there. It will build the host cross-compilation toolchain from scratch though, since that is available under output, and `make clean` removes everything there.

I've now got Node.js 0.10.12 working successfully on the Linux system.
