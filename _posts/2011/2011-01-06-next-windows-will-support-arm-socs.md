A while  back I wrote about [MeeGo]({% link _posts/2010/2010-09-16-meego---an-alternative-to-android-.md %}) and how it mainly seemed like a push against Android and ARM, at least in openness.

In mid 2010, Intel [announced](https://www.intel.com/pressroom/archive/releases/2010/20100601comp.htm) Atom SoCs (codenamed Oak Trail) targeting Android and MeeGo, besides Windows 7. Now, we come full circle with Microsoft [announcing](https://news.microsoft.com/2011/01/05/microsoft-announces-support-of-system-on-a-chip-architectures-from-intel-amd-and-arm-for-next-version-of-windows/) that its core Windows OS will support ARM SoCs from Nvidia and others, besides SoCs from Intel.

That is a fairly important move considering how mobile computing has come of age. Note that Windows Mobile / Phone already does support such architectures, so this may hint at a future unification of Windows. I hope Nokia doesn't get lost between Symbian and MeeGo.
