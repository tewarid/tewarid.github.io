# Port 443 (HTTPS)

I was testing the [TCP relay mechanism]({% link _posts/2011/2011-07-19-a-tcp-relay-mechanism-with-node.js.md %}) using a VM on the [Amazon EC2](http://www.embracingthecloud.com/2010/12/05/InstallingNodejsOnAmazonEC2.aspx) and came across an interesting realization regarding port 443.

My network at work blocks all ports except 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS). I tried relaying using port 80 and realized that they also have a [squid](http://www.squid-cache.org/) instance that caches data, which basically restricts any access through port 80 to purely HTTP requests. I then decided to relay over port 443 and it worked! So, if you ever want to use a port to get out of even a tightly secured network, try port 443.

For the curious who may be asking themselves as to how I could access Amazon EC2 from my work network, I used the excellent [VPNUK](http://vpnuk.net/) service. It only works from my work network over TCP and port 443.
