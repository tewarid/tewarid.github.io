# JavaScript style guides

There are several style guides for JavaScript but these are my personal favorites

1. Felix's Node.js [Style Guide](http://nodeguide.com/style.html)

2. Google JavaScript [Style Guide](http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javascriptguide.xml)

3. Crockford's [Code Conventions](http://javascript.crockford.com/code.html) for the JavaScript Programming Language

In that order of preference. If you are a beginner, you might want to read them bottom-up.
